RECTS5

Your task is to read a list of point pairs (X1, Y1, X2, Y2), logically construct rectangles and lastly determine if there is a path available between a start position of 0,0 and any of the corners of the 'universe' (+/- U, +/- U). You can only move up down left and right. Each move counts as one step. If there is a path available, you must determine how many steps to get to a corner of the universe. No rectangle will cover the 'entrance' (0,0) of the universe.

The input will consist of one integer to determine how many test batches will be given (T). Then for each batch the first line will be 2 integers. One to determine how many rectangles in that batch (N) and also one integer to determine the size of the universe (U) and lastly 4 integers on N lines that represent a single rectangle (X1 Y1 X2 Y2).

The output will consist of a simple 'Yes' or 'No' to signify whether the universe can be exited. If yes, print the length of the path.
	
LIMITS:
	
	0 < T <= 10; T = Integer
	0 < U <= 100; U = Integer
	0 < N <= 1000; N = Integer
	-200 <= X1,Y1,X2,Y2 <= 200; X1,Y1,X2,Y2 = Integer
