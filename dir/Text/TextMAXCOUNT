MAXCOUNT

	Given a a few (T) lists (length N) of integers, your task is to find the element which repeats the most number of times as well as the corresponding count. In case of ties, the smallest element wins.

	The first line contains an integer (T) that represents the number of tests, the next 2T lines alternate between another integer (N) and N integers on the same line representing the amount of elements in the set and the set it's self respectively.

	Your job is to output 2 integers, space separated on one line. The first being the most frequently found lowest number and it's frequency.

LIMITS:
	
	0 < T <= 100; T = Integer
	0 < N <= 100; N = Integer
	0 < A[N] <= 10000; A[N] = Integer

SAMPLE INPUT:

	2
	5
	1 2 3 2 5
	6
	1 2 2 1 1 2
	
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

	2 2
	1 3
	
EXPLANATION:

	First test case, 2 was only number seen multiple times (twice).
	
	Second test case, 1 and 2 were both seen 3 times however, 1 < 2.
