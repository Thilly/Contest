RECTS3

	Your job is to read a list of points. Logically construct rectangles for each pair of sequential points and calculate the total area of the 'chain' of rectangles. This time taking overlaps into consideration.

	The input will start with how many batches will be given (T), The individual batches then start with how many points are to be read in (N) then you will be given 1 point per line (X Y).

	There is no particular order to the points. The output will consist of 1 number, how much total area is taken up by all of the rectangles. 

You are not tasked with accounting for overlapping rectangles.

LIMITS:

	0 < T <= 100; T = Integer
	0 < N <= 1000; N = Integer
	-100 <= X,Y <= 100; X,Y = Integer

SAMPLE INPUT:

	2
	4
	0 0 
	1 1
	2 3
	-1 2
	3
	0 0
	1 1
	2 2
	
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

	5
	2
	
EXPLANATION:

	In the first test the 4 points create 3 rectangles, 
	0,0 and 1,1
	1,1 and 2,3
	2,3 and -1,2
	
	Their respective areas are 1, 2, 3. 
	However the third rectangle overlaps the second rectangle by one unit, so it only adds 2 'new' units of area.
