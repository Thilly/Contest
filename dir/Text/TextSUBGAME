SUBGAME

	Lets play a game on a sequence of N positive integers (A1, A2, ... An). The game is played as follows.
	If all the numbers are equal, the game ends.
		Otherwise
		Select two numbers which are unequal
		Subtract the smaller number from the larger number
		Replace the larger number with the result from above
		
	We know that the game always terminates. We also know, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the same value, no matter how the game is played. Simulate the game for us and determine what value the game terminates on.

	The input consists of a single integer (T) on the first line followed by T test cases. For each test case, there is a single integer (N) on one line and N integers on the following line. 
	
	You will output T integers, one for each test case representing the result of running the simulation on the N integers at the same time.
	
LIMITS:
	
	0 < T <= 100; T = Integer
	0 < N <= 60; N = Integer
	0 < A <= 10000; A = Integer
