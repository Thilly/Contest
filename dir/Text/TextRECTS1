RECTS1

	Your job is to read a list of points and calculate the area formed by each rectangle constructed by the two points given. 

	The input starts with how many rectangles are to be calculated (N), then you will be given two points per line (X1 Y1 X2 Y2). 

	There is no particular order to the points. 

	The output will consist of one number for each pair of points, representing the area that the rectangle takes up.

LIMITS:
	
	0 < N <= 1000; N = Integer
	-100 <= X,Y <= 100; X,Y = Integer

SAMPLE INPUT:

	3
	0 0 1 1
	-5 -5 5 5
	7 -1 8 5
	
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

	1
	100
	6
	
EXPLANATION:

	A 1x1 rectangle has an area of 1.
	A 10x10 rectangle has an area of 100.
	A 1x6 rectangle has an area of 6.
